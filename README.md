## How to play
From the home page you need to click the "Play" button. You will then be redirected to the start page where you can choose amount of questions, a difficulty level and a category. You then need to click the "Start" button which makes the game start and redirects you to the question page. Here you need to answer all questions and when you have done this you will be redirected to the result page where your total score will be displayed. You will also be able to see which questions you either answered correctly or incorrectly.
